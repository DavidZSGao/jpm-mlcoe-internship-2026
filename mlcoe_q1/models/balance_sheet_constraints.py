"""Identity-preserving balance sheet projection helpers.

This module encodes a minimal deterministic backbone inspired by the
VÃ©lez-Pareja literature: given high-level drivers (sales growth, margin,
capital expenditure ratio, payout policy) it advances the balance sheet
while guaranteeing that Assets = Liabilities + Equity at every step.

The intent is to expose building blocks that can be composed with
TensorFlow models or classical forecasting pipelines. A neural network
can learn to predict the driver vectors, while the functions here enforce
accounting structure and return fully specified statements.
